# Who Am I?
I'm Willie Chalmers III, a student studying computer science at The University of
Texas at Dallas. I'm deeply invested in the field of artificial intelligence and
desire to do research in the field long-term.

## What Do I Do?
I was an undergraduate researcher for Polycraft World in the Center for
Engineering Innovation at UT Dallas as part of a government-funded grant focusing on
building agents that can adapt to open-world environments. (I developed tools for a
Minecraft mod for AI.)

In the meantime, I've been busy reimplementing some research papers. My code isn't
very functional (since I haven't taken any formal machine learning class yet), but
my PI says I'm industrious and knows I can figure it out with enough time (and the
right questions).

Previously, I was an officer for the UTD student chapter of the [Association for Computing
Machinery](https://acmutd.co). I've built the
HackUTD organization website, home of the largest hackathon in north Texas; led
the development of the Nebula Planner, an interactive tool for course planning (and soon
to be so much more); and the [UTD Survival Guide](https://github.com/UTDNebula/survival-guide),
a college survival guide to answer the burning questions of UTD students.

I also formerly create workshops and other projects for the Artificial Intelligence Society
at UTD.
