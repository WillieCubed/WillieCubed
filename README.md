# Who Am I?
I'm Willie Chalmers III, a student studying computer science at The University of
Texas at Dallas. I'm deeply invested in the field of artificial intelligence and
desire to do research in the field long-term.

## What Do I Do?
Right now, I am an undergraduate researcher for Polycraft World in the Center for
Engineering Innovation at UT Dallas as part of a DARPA-funded grant focusing on
building agents that can adapt to open-world environments. (I develop tools for a
Minecraft mod for AI.) In the fall, I'll hopefully be able to collaborate with a
lab in Georgia Tech (remotely, of course) who's also working on the grant.

In the meantime, I've been busy reimplementing some research papers. My code isn't
very functional (since I haven't taken any formal machine learning class yet), but
my PI says I'm industrious and knows I can figure it out with enough time (and the
right questions).

As an officer for the UTD student chapter of the [Association for Computing
Machinery](https://acmutd.co), I write code for the UTD community. I've built the
HackUTD organization website, home of the largest hackathon in north Texas; led
the development of Comet Planning, an interactive tool for course planning (and soon
to be so much more); and soon a college survival guide to answer the burning questions
of UTD students.

I also create workshops and other projects for the Artificial Intelligence Society
at UTD. This semester, I'll focus on building something *really* cool and interactive
involving reinforcement learning.

**There's a million things I haven't done, but just you wait.**
