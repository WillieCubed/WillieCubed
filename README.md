Hi, I'm Willie Chalmers III, a computer science graduate from The University of
Texas at Dallas. In addition to creating projects to grow my technical skills,
I'm deeply invested in the field of artificial intelligence and desire to do
research in the field long-term.

## What Do I Do?

### ðŸ’» I build things.

I was the founder of [Nebula Labs](https://utdnebula.com), an organization dedicated
to building tools to enhance students' educational experiences. I grew a team of
four full-stack developers to a communiy of over thirty product designers, UI/UX
designers, and engineers of all types spanning four product teams. Nebula Labs'
first and flagship product is the [Nebula Planner](https://planner.utdnebula.com),
a drag-and-drop degree plan tool that validates graduation requirements.

Previously, I was a director of engineering for the UTD student chapter of the
[Association for Computing Machinery](https://acmutd.co). In that role, I led the
creation and deployment of [HackPortal](https://github.com/acmutd/hackportal), an ambitious
open-source hackathon management system and user experience for the largest hackathon
in north Texas.

I also formerly served as the secretary and director of technology for the
[Artificial Intelligence Society](https://aisutd.org), a student-led nonprofit
dedicated to making artificial intelligence accessible to a wider audience.
There, I presented [workshops](https://github.com/aisutd/god-pong) and oversaw AIM, a
mentorship program for students passionate in artificial intelligence. I also redesigned
and rebuilt the website using Next.js and rolled out Google Workspace to 30+ team members.

### ðŸ“„ I conduct research.

I was a research assistant in the Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab at UT Dallas,
working on a project to build a system that could learn discrete semantic concepts
from visual data.

I was an undergraduate researcher for Polycraft World in the Center for
Engineering Innovation at UT Dallas as part of a government-funded grant focusing on
building agents that can adapt to open-world environments. (I developed tools for a
Minecraft mod for AI.)

In the meantime, I've been busy reimplementing some research papers. My code isn't
very functional (since I haven't taken any formal machine learning class yet), but
my PI says I'm industrious and knows I can figure it out with enough time (and the
right questions).
